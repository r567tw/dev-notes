:::info
If you don’t use pretty permalinks, use “?rest_route=” instead of “wp-json”. Either way, what you’re seeing here is an example of a route and an endpoint. “/wp-json/” and “/?rest_route=/” are routes. They allow you to access the WordPress REST API through the GET HTTP method. The WordPress REST API displayed to you, or the data if you will, is an endpoint served to us via a JSON response.
